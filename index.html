                        About Cancer in children
                    </h1>
                    Childhood cancer constitutes 3 to 4 % of all cancers.
                    Every year 4 lakh children all over the world get
                    diagnosed with cancer, out of which India has an
                    estimated 76805 cases of new childhood cancer cases
                    detected every year. Unlike adult cancers, the causes of
                    most childhood cancers are as yet unknown but in
                    developed countries more than 80% of childhood cancer
                    is curable because of better response to the treatment
                    and protocols. Despite these high cure rates in developed
                    countries, it is estimated that in India, less than 30% of
                    children get cured largely due to lack of awareness, late
                    detection and late diagnosis, inadequate facilities, the
                    high cost of treatment and the absence of
                    supportive care.​<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_C-zl_rz1Szjf4mkx5dhVMVnXXj3paSFHcWLdI-nfyo/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">Click Here</a> to know more</p>

                <h1>Our journey so far</h1>
                Started in October 2021, Amogh Foundation has been
                engaging with cancer hospitals in Delhi for concessional
                treatments to poor children and also raising funds for the
                same. Currently while treatment costs varies differently for
                different types of cancer, on an average the concessional
                rate of treatment works out to approx. Rs. 1.50 lakhs for
                radiation/ surgery, Rs. 3.00 lakhs for Chemotherapy per
                child (who are below poverty line) as against average cost
                of Rs.4.5 lakh to Rs.6 lakhs.
                During the last 4 months, Amogh Foundation has raised
                funds and helped fund the surgery of a 5 year old child
                battling pelvic Bone cancer (Ewing’s Sarcoma) as a part of
                her cancer treatment. Testimonials and video to be
                attached.
